Ad Performance: Finding the "Gold Mines" 📈
I took a massive, messy dataset of 70k+ ad rows and turned it into a clear story about where money is being spent versus where engagement is actually happening.

The Problem
Marketing data is often "noisy." In this set, CTR values were scaled incorrectly, and looking at the raw numbers made it impossible to see which platforms were actually efficient.

What I Did
Cleaned the "Noise": Used Python to standardize the metrics and fixed a common "double-multiplication" error in the CTR percentages.

Built for Humans: Instead of a wall of charts, I used UI/UX principles to create a clean, interactive dashboard in Power BI.

The "Value Finder": Created a scatter plot that instantly shows the "Gold Mines"—ads that have high engagement but low cost.

Key Insight
By filtering for Weekends vs. Weekdays, the dashboard reveals that engagement patterns shift significantly, allowing for better budget timing.
